{"name":"LivestreamerFM","tagline":"An HTTP audio server for Livestreamer ","body":"# LivestreamerFM\r\n\r\nRight now, this is just an extremely small command-line utility that uses [Livestreamer](http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/)\r\nand [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) to create an audio http server that streams audio from your favorite \r\nLivestreamer streams. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Requirements:\r\nLivestreamerFM is written in Scala (and thus requires Java to be installed). If you want to build this from source,\r\nyou'll need [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), and something like \r\n[SBT-Assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) installed.  \r\n\r\nBoth VLC and Livestreamer must be installed before using this program. Installation instructions for Livestreamer are\r\nfound [here](http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/install.html) and installation instructions for VLC are found\r\n[here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html#download). \r\n\r\nMake sure that Livestreamer is in your system path (this should be done automatically when installing livestreamer).\r\n##Command-line usage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRun it from the command-line with these options:\r\n\r\n    [STREAM_URL] [IP_ADDRESS] [PORT] [LIVESTREAMER_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION]\r\n\r\nOr: \r\n\r\n    --config [LIVESTREAMERFM_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION] [STREAM_URL]\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n    twitch.tv/arteezy localhost 9999 ~/configs/\r\n\r\nOr: \r\n\r\n    --config ~/Desktop/LSFMconfig.txt twitch.tv/arteezy\r\n    \r\nFull Example (plus `java -jar` call):\r\n\r\n    java -jar whatever_you_called_livestreamerFM.jar twitch.tv/arteezy localhost 9999 ~/configs/\r\n\r\n`STREAM_URL`: The URL of the stream that you want to play.\r\n\r\n`IP_ADDRESS`: The ip address that you want the http server to bind to.\r\n\r\n`PORT`: The port that you want the http server to bind to.\r\n\r\n`LIVESTREAMER_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION`: This utility generates a config file that the Livestreamer app uses. This part of the\r\ncommand tells livestreamerFM what folder to store the generated file in. Remember that the path should end in a `/`\r\n(or a `\\` if you are using Windows).\r\n\r\n`LIVESTREAMERFM_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION`: The location of the LivestreamerFM config file, format described below.\r\n\r\nLivestreamerFM will then display the location of the audio stream, so that you can copy and paste it into your \r\nfavorite audio player. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    ****** twitch.tv/arteezy AUDIO STREAM LOCATED @ http://192.168.1.1:9999 ******\r\n\r\n##LivestreamerFM config file format:\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n\r\n    player = /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC\r\n    delay = 5005\r\n    ipAndPort = 192.168.1.1:9999\r\n    livestreamerConfigLocation = /Users/gmgilmore/\r\n\r\nThe file should be a plain text file with each new line having the following format:\r\n\r\n    [OPTION] = [VALUE]\r\n\r\nThe options that you can choose from are `player` , `delay` , `ipAndPort` , and `livestreamerConfigLocation`. All these\r\noptions are optional (heh) - you can include any of them, or none of them. They are also case-insensitive.\r\n    \r\nIf you don't follow this format, livestreamerFM will display an error when it tries to read the file. \r\n\r\n###Option descriptions:\r\n\r\n`player` - The value should be path to the vlc executable on your machine. If this option is not used, LivestreamerFM will\r\nattempt to guess where VLC is located on your machine. \r\n\r\n`delay` - The value should be number of milliseconds that you want LivestreamerFM to cache the audio for. This is used to\r\nimprove performance and mitigate stuttering. If this option is not used, `delay` will default to 5000 ms.\r\n\r\n`ipAndPort` - The value should the IP address that you want the audio server to bind to, followed by the port that you want\r\nthe audio server to use, separated by a colon. If this option is not used, `ipAndPort` will default to `localhost:9999`.\r\n\r\n`livestreamerConfigLocation` - The value should be the path that you want the livestreamer config file that is generated\r\nby livestreamerFM to be saved in. If this option is not used, `livestreamerConfigLocation` will default to the directory\r\nthat livestreamerFM is running in. \r\n\r\n##TODO:\r\n-~~add config file support so that you don't have to type in all these commands every time~~ Done.\r\n\r\n-~~add support for sites other than twitch.tv and youtube~~ Done-ish. I figured out how to get vlc to only stream the \r\naudio from a video, but I haven't tested this with every single site on the supported site list for livestreamer.\r\n\r\n-~~add basic parsing of url so that there is an url -> audio_option matching~~ Done.\r\n\r\n-~~add support for windows and linux (this involves figuring out how to look through the path maybe), will involve some \r\nrefactoring~~ Done. LivestreamerFM now attempts to guess the path that vlc installed in for windows, linux, and OSX. \r\nUsers can also use the --config option to specify the vlc path manually using the config file.\r\n\r\n-write basic webui\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
